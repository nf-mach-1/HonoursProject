The following code is hosted on google colab. So if you want to use it on the desktop. I will suggest you install all the necessary packages
which are need for the imported packages.
Or you can run it on google colab or use jupyter notebook, these 2 platforms have some of the packages installed in them so, it will be easy to run it 

The file that ends with .ipynb is the notebook for the code which was run from google colab, and it shows the results of the project. 
The file that ends with .py is the code which is also found on the notebook.
